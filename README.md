## Features


### Airflow run 

When you are on Airflow user interface in one of these two situations :
* The modal showing actions for a specific task is opened 
* The page is a _Task instance_ page (i.e. _Task Instance detail, Rendered Template, Log_ or _XCom_)


On Airflow user interface, click on extension button and a command will be automatically generated if possible.
It will automatically generate `airflow run dag_id task_id execution_date`.
Then the command is directly copied to clipboard

### Running Command

On the log page of a task, the extension will fetch the `Running command` called by the task if it exists.

### Highlight DAGs

It is possible to define a list of DAGs which will be highlighted on Airflow UI.

Open extension popup and then click on "_Settings_".

In _settings_ page, define a list of DAGs name in _csv_ (_e.g. dag1,dag2,dag3_) inthe textarea under "_List of dags to highlight_". 
Then on Airflow UI _"DAGs"_ page, if a DAG name contains one of the name defined in option, the line will be highlighted.

> It is possible to customize style applied to highlighted DAG's in _Option page_. You just need to change the CSS style.

### Color Navbar depending on environment

It is possible to distinguish Airflow environment depending on URL to use a custom color for prod and/or staging.

In settings section, it is possible to add a list of url (_csv format_) for prod and staging, and to define a dedicated 
color.

### Color Blind friendly

It is possible to choose colors for each task state to use most appropriate set of colors depending on possible color blindness.
