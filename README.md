# Airflow Extension

Browser Extension to improve Airflow UI User Experience.

Compatible with Chrome and Firefox.
This extension has been tested on the following Airflow versions:
- 2.2.2
- 2.6.3
- 2.8.1

This extension is not available on Chrome and Firefox stores. You'll need to build it yourself, you'll see how in the [Installation section](#installation).

## Features
### Highlight DAGs

It is possible to define a list of DAGs which will be highlighted on Airflow UI.

Open extension popup and then click on "_Settings_".

In _settings_ page, define a list of DAGs name in _csv_ (_e.g. dag1,dag2,dag3_) in the textarea under "_List of dags to highlight_". 
Then on Airflow UI _"DAGs"_ page, if a DAG name contains one of the name defined in option, the line will be highlighted.

> It is possible to customize style applied to highlighted DAG's in _Option page_. You just need to change the CSS style.

### Color Navbar depending on environment

It is possible to distinguish Airflow environment depending on URL to use a custom color for prod and/or staging.

In settings section, it is possible to add a list of url (_csv format_) for prod and staging, and to define a dedicated 
color. Urls can contain wildcards - e.g. `airflow-*.prod.*.mycompany.com`
