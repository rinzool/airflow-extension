On Airflow user interface, click on extension button and a command will be automatically generated if possible.

> For **Chrome** users, the command is directly copied to clipboard

### Airflow run 

When you are on Airflow user interface in one of these two situations :
* The modal showing actions for a specific task is opened 
* The page is a _Task instance_ page (i.e. _Task Instance detail, Rendered Template, Log_ or _XCom_)

It will automatically generate `airflow run dag_id task_id execution_date`.

### Running Command

On the log page of a task, the extension will fetch the `Running command` called by the task if it exists.

## Updates

To get last updates :
* `git pull`
* `./build.sh`
* Reload extension on your browser
